The most interesting trends (and non-surprising after working in education for 6 years) that I observed were:
    1. The size of the school has an impact on the passing rate.  This is usually due to class size.  Schools that are bigger don't have enough teachers to keep class sizes on the small size which can impact student success.
    2. The more money budgeted per student did not improve the passing rate.  In fact, it was opposite.  The schools with a smaller budget per student had higher passing rates.  Throwing money at schools does not equal greater student success.
